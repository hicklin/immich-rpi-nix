# Alternative setup procedures

This chapter contains alternative setup procedures. Alternative setup procedures heavily refer to the steps covered in the main [Setup](../setup/0-introduction.md) section. Content in this section is mostly intended to be referred to from the main setup section.

The alternative setup procedures covered are as follows:
- **[Migration processing off RPi](./1-migration-processing-off-rpi.md)**: Describes a setup procedure where media assets are initially imported to and instance of immich running on a more powerful machine. This procedure is useful when there are a lot of assets to be imported as the RPi may be overwhelmed with the intensity of the processing tasks without manual management.
- **[Build RPi image locally](./2-build-image-locally.md)**: Describes building a RPi image on a local machine. This is useful for development.
- **[Setup RPi from vanilla NixOS image](./3-install-from-vanilla-image.md)**: Describes setting up the RPi from the latest NixOS image. These instructions are included mostly to document known nuances with this process. This procedure in not actively used so instructions may get outdated.
- **[Proton Drive Backup](./4-proton-drive-backups.md)**: Brief indication of using Proton Drive for backups.
