# Proton Drive Backups

In a sensible world, you would be using Proton services as they offer private emails, calendar and drive solutions. In a sensible world, Proton would provide basic Proton Drive support for Linux. At the time of writing, they don't!

If you are a proton customer or interested in becoming one, please email them about their lack of support for Linux and how this is effecting you. It might push them to officially support the most common OS on the planet, and probably in space.

### If proton was supported with [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/protondrive/)

Proton drive support for `rclone` varies with time. Proton dose not officially support `rclone` and does not publish the Proton Drive API. Hence, the community is left reverse engineering Proton applications to add support to `rclone`. Apart form this, the amazing work of the open-source community is sometimes thwarted by Proton in such a way that requires Proton to fix. Hence, I can't recommended the use of Proton Drive at this time, even if you are already paying for hundreds of gigabytes that you can't use.

If you are reading this in the future, where hopefully the world has become a bit less silly, you might be able to use `rclone` to backup data to Proton Drive. Proton Drive has end-to-end encryption and zero-trust storage which would make it ideal for this task.
